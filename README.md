⚠️ This is a mock version created using dummy data. The actual project is under NDA as part of an internship.

📌 About the Project
A full-stack project simulating a real-world WhatsApp Bot for insurance customer support — featuring category-wise smart replies, fuzzy search, and a modern React dashboard for monitoring.


While the real project contains private data, a fully functional mock version is included for demo purposes. The dashboard fetches dummy chat data and renders them just like the real system.
