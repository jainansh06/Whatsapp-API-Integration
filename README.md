⚠️ This is a mock version created using dummy data. The actual project is under NDA as part of an internship.

## 📌 About the Project
A full-stack project simulating a real-world WhatsApp Bot for insurance customer support — featuring category-wise smart replies, fuzzy search, and a modern React dashboard for monitoring.
- Rule-based and AI-powered replies
- Insurance-related categories: Policies, Claims, and Hospitals
- Smart fallback replies via **Cohere** and **OpenAI**
- MongoDB logging of conversations
- Real-time dashboard to view chat history

## 🧠 Features

### 🔧 Backend (Node.js + Express)

- WhatsApp webhook integration (Meta Cloud API)
- Smart replies using:
  - Rule-based matching
  - Fuzzy search for category recognition
  - AI fallback (Cohere, OpenAI, Gemini-ready)
- MongoDB-based chat logging
- CORS-enabled for frontend communication


While the real project contains private data, a fully functional mock version is included for demo purposes. The dashboard fetches dummy chat data and renders them just like the real system.
